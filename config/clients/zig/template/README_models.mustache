### Models

The SDK provides Zig structs for all API request and response types. Key models include:

- `Store`: Represents an OpenFGA store
- `AuthorizationModel`: Represents an authorization model
- `TupleKey`: Represents a relationship tuple
- `CheckResponse`: Response from a check operation
- `WriteRequest`: Request to write relationship tuples

For a complete list of models, see the generated `models` directory.
